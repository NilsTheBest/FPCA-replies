I'll remove your project from the "reviewing" studio for now, feel free to add it back to the submissions studio here: https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/4276585/ once you think you're ready again. Have a good day! :D</textarea>

		<textarea class="CopyText" id="Text7" readonly>Hello! Thanks for making a project for the Welcoming Committee! :D However, you must wait until you obtain the "Scratcher" status before submitting a welcoming project, as it is for welcoming new scratchers. However, you can still help out by welcoming other people in the main studio! :) Feel free to re-add or make a new project and submit it in the submissions studio here: https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/4276585/ once you've obtained the "scratcher" status! :)</textarea>
